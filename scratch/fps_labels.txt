Columns are:
0th: unique index
fpX: x position of fiber in focal plane (mm)
fpY: y position of fiber in focal plane (mm)
fvcX: x position of centroid in CCD (pixels)
fvcY: y position of centroid in CCD (pixels)
rFP: radial position of fiber in focal plane (mm)
rFVC: radial position of centroid in CCD (pixels)
thetaFP: angular position of fiber in focal plane (degrees)
thetaFVC: angular position of centroid in CCD (degrees)
fiducial: whether or not this is a fiducial location (boolean)

The maximum radial distance in the focal plane we can reach with a science fiber is about 313.6 mm
